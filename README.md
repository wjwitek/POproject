Inside the simulation, user has four options, independent for each map:
- **Stop/Start** - stop and restarts simulation
- **Highlight** - starts higlighting animals, whose genome is a mode. Pressing button again stops highlighting.
- **Save** - saves history of simulation (what is displayed on charts) into CSV file. Requires simulation to be stopped.
- **Animal** - single animal can be pressed, which displays its genome and starts tracking its offspring. Requires stimulation to be stopped.
